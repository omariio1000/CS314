**Current Idea** - Omar

Have a list of reports in the main

Each report is tied to a provider and has a list of records as well as total bill and total consultation for the week

Each record holds a provider and a member, as well as some other info

The member class can be used for either a provider or a member, with a bool that indicates which it is

*Rough Draft* - Just what I thought made sense and needed the least amount of classes
